# Hi again, <span class="whitespace-nowrap">I'm Victor Ukam.</span>

Married to a wonderful soul, my dedication to creative problem-solving has fueled my journey for over a decade. I've engaged in diverse activities, from crafting web applications using Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind to overseeing the servers that support them.

Some interesting projects I've worked on include:

* Recommender systems.
* AI-powered Documents collaboration tools.
* Marketplaces (loan-funded, B2C & B2B).
* Corrosion detection model for underwater images.

I care about open-source software, privacy, best practices, open standards, clean/maintainable code, and great user and developer experiences. Iâ€™m open to exciting opportunities where I can leverage my expertise to drive innovative projects and contribute to organizational success. <a href="mailto:victorjohnukam@gmail.com">Shoot me a mail</a>, Let's connect!

When I'm not coding, I enjoy precious moments with my lovely wife, prioritize fitness routines, and stay connected with friends and family.
